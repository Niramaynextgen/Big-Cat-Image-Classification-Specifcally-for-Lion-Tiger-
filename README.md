# Big-Cat-Image-Classification-Specifcally-for-Lion-Tiger-
This project tackles a real problem in wildlife surveillance and big-cat research by accurately classifying lions and tigers from images. Because these species share strong visual similarities, misclassification is common. The model supports monitoring, conservation, and research efforts using deep learning.
